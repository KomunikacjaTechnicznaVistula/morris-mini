# Will SVGs render?

## Will they now?  
  
*Hey mama, look, an SVG image:*  
![SVG in question](/assets/images/Test.svg)

*And here is yet another one, but it is still rendered as an image:*  
![SVG in question](/assets/images/test_from_diagrams_app.svg)

*And here is yet another one, this time entered as a Jekyll include:*  
{% include image_with_links.svg %}

Here I am testing an *inline style*{: style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: normal;"}. Let's hope it works.
