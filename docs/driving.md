## Using the pedal controls

The foot pedals control the acceleration and braking of the car and the clutch pedal allows you to engage the gears.
The pedal controls are, from left to right, the clutch, brake and accelerator.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** References to right or left hand sides in this book are made when viewing the vehicle from the rear.

**‚ùóÔ∏è Warning:** Do not drive with your foot resting on the clutch pedal.

- Depress the pedal with your foot to engage the control.
- Lift your foot off the pedal to disengage the control.

## Changing gears

The gear lever is used to switch between the different gears to allow you to drive the car.
Depress the clutch foot pedal to engage a gear.

*Gear lever*

The lever is centrally situated and defaults to neutral gear.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** References to right or left hand sides in this book are made when viewing the vehicle from the rear.

From the neutral position, move the lever:
- left and forwards to select first gear.
- left and backwards to select second gear.
- forwards to select third gear.
- backwards to select fourth gear.
- right and backwards to select reverse gear.

## Using the hand brake

The hand brake engages the rear wheel brake shoes to keep the vehicle stationary when you are not driving. Use the hand brake when you have parked the vehicle or when you are stopped on a steep hill.

The vehicle must come to a complete stop before you engage the hand brake.

The handbrake is a lever located next to the driver's seat. It engages the rear wheel brake shoes to keep the vehicle stationary. You can also use the handbrake when driving, for example, when stopped on a steep hill it will prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards before the forward gear engages.

To apply the brake, pull the lever upwards until it holds. The lever is on a ratchet. You will feel increasing tension as you pull upwards.

To release the brake, pull the lever slightly upward to take the load. Press and hold the ratchet release button on the tip of the lever with your thumb, then push the lever fully downwards.

## Sounding the horn

The horn makes a loud noise. Use the horn when required to alert pedestrians or other drivers of your presence on the
road.

The horn will operate regardless of the ignition switch position.
1. Press the centre disc of the steering wheel.  
The horn sounds.
2. Release the horn to stop the sound.

## Using windshield wipers

The windshield wipers have rubber blades which wipe back and forth across the windshield, keeping rain and other precipitation from obscuring the driver's vision.

The windshield wiper switch is located on the left of the ignition switch.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** The windshield wipers only function when the ignition is switched on.

1. Move the switch downwards to turn the wipers on.
2. Move the switch upwards to turn off the wipers.  
**üìù Note:** Wait until the wipers are at the end of the stroke, horizontal (parallel with the bonnet) before switching off.  

## Indicating turning

The direction indicators let you signal to other drivers which direction you intend to turn.

The direction indicators cause the indicator lights at the front and rear of the vehicle exterior to flash intermittently.

These are operated by the switch lever on the right hand side of the steering wheel.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** References to right or left hand sides in this book are made when viewing the vehicle from the rear.

The flashing direction indicators will only operate when the ignition is switched on.
- Move the switch lever upwards to operate the left-hand flashing indicator for turning left.
- Move the switch lever downwards to operate the right-hand flashing indicator for turning right.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** A warning light in the end of the switch lever indicates when a direction indicator is in use.

## Turning on the headlights

There are two sets of exterior lights on the vechicle (pilot lights and headlights) used for night driving. They are
controlled by the same switch.

The headlight and pilot light switch is located to the right of the ignition switch on the control panel.

1. Move the switch downward to the central position.  
The pilot lights, tail lights and instrument lights are turned on.
2. Move the switch further downward to the lower position.  
The headlights are turned on.

## Dipping the headlight beams

The headlight beam dipping switch lets you lower the height of the headlight beams as a courtesy to oncoming vehicles.

The headlight beam dipping switch is located in the center of the toeboard and is foot-operated.

The switch is an on/off toggle, dipping the beams on one depression and raising them on the next.  
**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** A light at the top of the instrument dial glows blue when the beams are in the raised position.

1. Press the switch with your foot.  
The headlight beams dip.
2. Press the switch with your foot again.  
The headlight beams return to the their normal position.

## Wet brakes

Driving with wet brakes can be dangerous so you should try to avoid it. Be mindful of what can cause wet brakes and how to drive safely if your brakes do get wet.

The brake linings can become wet after the vehicle has been washed or driven through water.

Keep the hand brake fully on when using high-pressue washing equipment.

You can dry the brake linings by applying the brake several times when the vehicle is moving slowly.

## Running-in speeds

Running-in refers to the first 500 miles (800 km) of running the engine of a new vehicle. During the initial period you
shouldn't overly tax the engine.

The treatment given to the engine during this period has a bearing on its subsequent life. Therefore, you should limit
the engine speed during this early period of your new vehicle's life.

**üö´ Restriction:** Do not exceed 45 mph (72 kph).  
**üö´ Restriction:** Do not drive at full throttle in any gear.  
**üö´ Restriction:** Do not allow the engine to labour in any gear.
