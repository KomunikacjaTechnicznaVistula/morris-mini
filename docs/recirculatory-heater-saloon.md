# Recirculatory Heater - Saloon
{: .no_toc}

The heater is used to heat the interior of the vehicle to let you drive in comfort during cold weather. It can also be used to defrost the windshield. The Saloon model has a recirculatory heater which uses the engine to warm and recirculate air inside the vehicle.

The heater works by using hot water from the engine cooling system to warm the air, and uses a blower to circulate the air through the interior of the vehicle.

Use the heater in cold weather to warm and circulate the interior air. You can also use the heater to provide a current of hot air onto the windshield for demisting.

**üìù Note:** The heater blower only operates when the engine is switched on.

There are three controls to operate the heater: a temperature dial, a shutter on the heater unit box and a control valve.

## Adjusting the heat - Saloon

Use the heater thermostat dial to adjust the temperature of the heater.

The thermostat dial is located on the left of the control panel.

- The first few degrees of movement of the switch operate the heater motor at maximum speed.
- Turn the switch knob further to gradually reduce the speed of the blower to regulate the heating of the vehicle interior.

## Operating the heater shutter - Saloon

The heater unit box has a shutter which you can manually operate to circulate hot air in the vehicle.

The heater unit box is located under the control panel and is hand-operated.

**üìù Note:** The blower only circulates interior air. It does not introduce fresh air into the vehicle.
**‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip:** The heater unit box is not always cold when the heater is off because a certain amount of heat is always transfered to it from the engine.

- Push the shutter fully downwards to deflect hot air onto the windshield for demisting.

## Heater Control Valve - Saloon

A control valve in the engine, located on the right of the cyclinder head, opens and closes the water circulation for the heater.

Close the valve during hot weather when heating inside the vehicle is not required.
