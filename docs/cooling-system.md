# Cooling System
{: .no_toc}

The cooling system guards your engine against damage caused by the inevitable heat it generates. Maintance is usually required at times of extreme hot or cold weather.

## Draining the cooling system

After the second winter of running your vehicle, drain the cooling system and refill it with fresh water. Add the antifreeze when required.

There are two drain taps for draining the cooling system:
- at the base of radiator on the forward side
- on the rear of the cyclinder block.

Both taps are accessible from under the bonnet.

*Radiator drain taps*

Some vehicles are fitted with a drain plug instead of a tap. This plug must be removed to drain the radiator.
1. Open both taps and remove the filler cap to drain the cooling system completely.  
**ℹ️ Tip:** Collect any anti-freeze in a clean container for future use.
2. Insert a hose in the filling orifice and allow water to flow through the system until clean.

## Filling the cooling system

Fill the cooling system after you have drained it and keep it topped up to the level of the indicator.

To avoid overfilling and therefore wasting coolant, add just sufficient coolant to cover the bottom of the header tank.
1. Run the engine until it is hot.
2. Add sufficient coolant to bring the surface to the level of the indicator positioned inside the header tank, below the filler neck.

## Anti-freeze amounts

The amount of anti-freeze required depends on a few things.

Use ethylene glycol anti-freeze incorporating the correct type of corrosion inhibitor. Bluecol Anti-freeze brand is recommended, or any anti-freeze which conforms to Specification B.S. 3152 or B.S. 3152.

The amounts of anti-freeze quoted in this table apply to vehicles fitted with a heater. For vehicles without a heater the amounts can be reduced using the Solution % column to calculate the amount required.

| Solution % | freezing at | Absolute safe limit | Quantity of anti-freeze required |
|:-----------|:------------|:--------------------|:---------------------------------|
| 20 | -9 C / 16 F | -19 C / -3 F | 1 1/4 (.71 litre) |
| 25 | -13 C / 9 F | -26 C / -15 F | 1 1/2 pts (.85 litre) |
| 30 | -16 C / 3 F | -33 C / -28 F | 2 pts (1.14 litres) |

## Releasing pressure

If the engine overheats, you may want to add water to the radiator to help cool it down. You will need to release pressure from the radiator first.

The cooling system on this vehicle is pressurised. Release the pressure gradually when removing the radiator cap - which will be hot after driving.

*Radiator cap*

1. Protect your hands using gloves or a cloth to avoid risk of burns from escaping steam.
2. Turn the radiator cap anti-clockwise until you feel the resistance of the safety stop.
3. Leave the cap in this position until all the pressure is released.
4. Press the cap downwards against the spring to clear the saftey stops, and continue turning until it can be lifted off.

**ℹ️ Tip:** A water level indicator is fitted inside the header tank.

## Adding anti-freeze

Add anti-freeze liquid to the cooling system to maintain the running condition of the vehicle during cold weather.

If the water in the cooling system freezes, when it expands there is a risk it could burst the radiator, cylinder block or heater.

You can avoid this risk by draining the cooling system when the vehicle is left unused for any length of time in cold weather, or by adding anti-freeze to the water in the cooling system.

Anti-freeze can remain in the cooling system for up to two years provided that the specific gravity of the coolant is check periodically by your dealer and anti-freeze added as necessary.

**❗️ CAUTION:** Do not use radiator anti-freeze solution in the windshield-washing equipment.

1. Drain the cooling system.
2. When all the water is drained away, close the taps.  
  **📝 Note:**Refer to anti-freeze amounts to determine how much anti-freeze to use.
3. Pour in the anti-freeze.
4. Fill with water.
