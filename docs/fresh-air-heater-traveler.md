# Fresh air Heater - Traveller
{: .no_toc}

The heater is used to heat the interior of the vehicle to let you drive in comfort during cold weather. It can also be used to defrost the windshield. The Traveller model has a fresh-air heater which ventilates and circulates the interior air while it heats.

The heater works by using hot water from the engine cooling system to warm the air, and uses a shutter control and blower to distribute the air through the interior of the vehicle.

**📝 Note:** The heater blower only operates when the engine is switched on.

There are three controls to operate the heater: a control knob, a shutter control lever and a blower motor switch.

## Adjusting the heat - Traveller

Use the heater thermostat knob to adjust the temperature of the heater.

The level of heat is controlled by a knob on left of the control panel. This knob regulates the amount of hot water circulating in the heater system.

Push the knob fully in for the maximum amount of heat. You can adjust the knob to any position to meet varying heating requirements.

## Shutter control lever - Traveller

The shutter control lever is used to distribute air throughout the vehicle.

The shutter control lever is located under the control panel has three positions: CAR, SCREEN and OFF.

- CAR (top) position - air is distributed mainly to the interior of the vehicle, with some to the windshield.
- SCREEN (centre) position - air is directed onto the windshield, with some to the vehicle interior.
- OFF (bottom) position - the supply of air is cut off. No air is distributed.

## Blower motor switch - Traveller

The blower motor greatly increases the volume of heat output by increasing the supply of air to the heater unit.

The blower motor switch is located under the shutter control lever. It operates with a side-to-side movement.

Switch on the blower motor when maximum performance from the heater or ventilation system is required. It can also be used when travelling at low speed to compensate for lack of ram air effect (air intake to keep the engine cool).

**ℹ️ Tip:** If you notice unpleasant odours drawn in from the outside, switch off the blower motor and set the shutter control lever to OFF until outside conditions improve.
