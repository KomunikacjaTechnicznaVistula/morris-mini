*Jacking the car*  

1. Remove the rubber plug from the socket below the door on the exterior of the car.
2. Insert the arm of the jack into the socket.  
  The jack should lean slightly outwards at the top to allow for the radial movement of the vehicle as it is raised.
3. **❗️ CAUTION:** Avoid distorting the bracket and damaging the jack.  
  Ensure the bar is fully inserted into the jacking bracket before attempting to lift the car.

Hold the jack bar up into the jacking bracket with one hand and turn the jack screw with your other hand until the
car begins to lift.
